This link offers an archived disk image with all pre-requisites and the script installed.

https://www.mediafire.com/file/8mhjp8ptxt5bsdb/RPI_V1.1.7z/file

Once downloaded follow the steps below to use:
1. Unzip and use Win32 Disk Imager to create a disk image on a 16gb microSD card. Download Wind32 Disk Imager here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
NOTE: This has only be tested on a Raspberry Pi 4B 2gb with a 16gb microSD Card. Using something else may result in technical issues, but is untested.

2. Once the disk image is written to the SD card, simply insert into the RPi and it should boot without issue.

3. Connect a bluetooth device such as your phone or a tablet. Bluetooth is headless, so it shouldn't require any inputs from a user to connect.
The RPi should be called "raspberrypi" in your devices' bluetooth list.

4. Open terminal and type "python3 TouchDesk1.1.py" and press enter

5. The app should start up, the hard-coded password is "1234". This can be changed or disabled in the script. It will automatically log out after 15 minutes
of inactivity.
