# TouchDesk
Touch-screen based OSC enabled digital sound desk communication software for use on Raspberry Pi

TouchDesk is the working name for software to allow remote use of a digital sound desk from a Raspberry Pi using a touchscreen.
It allows a sound technician or installer to set up a sound desk as they would normally, but leave the end-user with a simple, clean, and limited interface
on what settings can be used or adjusted, thus preventing unintentional damage and limits confusion to those with little experience or knowledge of sound equipment.
A technician may use some of the advanced features of a sound desk such as parametric or graphical EQs, compressors, expanders, duckers, gain pots, or any other 
feature, and then presenting just a mute button and fader in a clean, low-profile, wall-mountable, touchscreen up to the max distance of a PoE enabled Cat5/6 cable. 
This can also be done over a wireless network if the Raspberry Pi is powered locally. It currently also provides a rudimentary interface for Bluetooth connectivity,
allowing the RPi to become a Bluetooth audio sink and outputting that audio to its 3.5mm stereo jack. This gives the installer the option of transferring audio into
the same sound desk to be manipulated by the TouchDesk software.
